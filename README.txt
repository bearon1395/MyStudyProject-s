For work, you need to make some settings such as:

1. Set raw material.
(the example uses an array whose elements:
- wheat 
- husk 
- soil )

2. Choose and create - WorkingTower and WheatDryer using their fabric.
3. Create Elevator and set parameters above.
3.1 Set Storage Bins with space.

4. Start Elevator using function tartConveyor();

At the output, we get the cleaned and dried grain, which is stored in silos.
